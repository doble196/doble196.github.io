        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My passion for blockchain started early, leading me to enroll in the
          Columbia FinTech Bootcamp. There, I gained hands-on experience with
          Python programming, building portfolio apps, creating forecasting
          models using tools like TensorFlow and SKLearn, and exploring
          algorithmic trading. I also mastered AWS Lambda for scalable,
          serverless solutions, and delved into smart contracts, blockchain
          design, NFTs, and dApps focused on financial payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Post-bootcamp, I expanded my skill set by mastering JavaScript, React,
          Next.js, and building micro front-ends. I developed
          <a href="http://www.githat.io" target="_blank">githat.io</a> using
          microservices architecture, allowing developers to work independently
          and securely. This approach ensures different parts of the app are
          loosely coupled, enabling seamless collaboration without interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm continuously refining my skills by building scalable, future-proof
          apps and managing LangChain and RAG models to develop highly secure
          and ethical systems. For instance, I can create secure, private
          systems for sensitive sectors like healthcare, ensuring they meet
          industry standards for privacy and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I’m excited about building a Layer 2 solution in Rust.
          I aim to lead in the blockchain space, bringing a unique blend of
          technical skills, passion, and innovation.

        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

        <div class="qa">
          <p class="question">
            Can you walk us through a recent project you’ve worked on, and what
            your role was?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Absolutely. A recent project I worked on was
            <a href="http://www.githat.io" target="_blank">githat.io</a>, where
            I developed a micro front-end architecture for a decentralized
            application. The key challenge was ensuring that different teams
            working on various parts of the app didn't need to interact with or
            even see each other's code. I used Next.js and React for the front
            end, along with microservices to isolate functionalities across
            different parts of the app. This allowed us to maintain privacy and
            security while ensuring a modular and scalable system. On the
            backend, I worked extensively with SQL for database management and
            implemented Webpack to streamline the build process for efficient
            deployment. My role was full-stack development, ensuring both the
            client-facing side and the backend systems were robust and scalable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
          <p class="question">
            How do you stay updated on the latest trends in blockchain and
            development?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I make it a priority to stay ahead of the curve by continuously
            learning. I regularly listen to podcasts focused on blockchain and
            software development trends, like The Defiant and Bankless, to stay
            updated on innovations in the space. I also follow developments on
            platforms like GitHub and Twitter, and I actively prototype new
            ideas, whether it's integrating LangChain or experimenting with RAG
            models. Additionally, I engage with documentation for tools like AWS
            and new AI models to stay sharp on both ethical practices and the
            technical side of development. By doing this, I can anticipate
            changes and ensure my projects are both scalable and secure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
          <p class="question">
            Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I believe I’m a great fit for this role because of my full-stack
            experience and deep expertise in blockchain. From developing smart
            contracts and building dApps to creating scalable micro front-ends,
            I have a well-rounded skill set that aligns perfectly with the
            technical requirements of this position. I’ve worked with Python,
            JavaScript, Next.js, and React, ensuring that I can handle both
            backend blockchain infrastructure and front-end user experiences
            seamlessly. My project management experience, like with githat.io,
            shows that I can lead and collaborate with teams effectively.
            Additionally, my ongoing learning with LangChain, AI, and Rust
            positions me to innovate in both the blockchain and AI spaces. I’m
            confident I can bring value by not only delivering on the current
            needs but also future-proofing solutions.
