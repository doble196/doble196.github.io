## Interview Q&A

### Can you walk us through a recent project you’ve worked on, and what your role was?

**Absolutely. A recent project I worked on was [githat.io](http://www.githat.io), where I developed a micro front-end architecture for a decentralized application. The key challenge was ensuring that different teams working on various parts of the app didn't need to interact with or even see each other's code. I used Next.js and React for the front end, along with microservices to isolate functionalities across different parts of the app. This allowed us to maintain privacy and security while ensuring a modular and scalable system. On the backend, I worked extensively with SQL for database management and implemented Webpack to streamline the build process for efficient deployment. My role was full-stack development, ensuring both the client-facing side and the backend systems were robust and scalable.**

### How do you stay updated on the latest trends in blockchain and development?

**I make it a priority to stay ahead of the curve by continuously learning. I regularly listen to podcasts focused on blockchain and software development trends, like The Defiant and Bankless, to stay updated on innovations in the space. I also follow developments on platforms like GitHub and Twitter, and I actively prototype new ideas, whether it's integrating LangChain or experimenting with RAG models. Additionally, I engage with documentation for tools like AWS, Solana, and new AI models to stay sharp on both ethical practices and the technical side of development. By doing this, I can anticipate changes and ensure my projects are both scalable and secure.**

### Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?

**I believe I’m a great fit for this role because of my full-stack experience and deep expertise in blockchain. From developing smart contracts and building dApps to creating scalable micro front-ends, I have a well-rounded skill set that aligns perfectly with the technical requirements of this position. I’ve worked with Python, JavaScript, Next.js, and React, ensuring that I can handle both backend blockchain infrastructure and front-end user experiences seamlessly. My project management experience, like with githat.io, shows that I can lead and collaborate with teams effectively. Additionally, my ongoing learning with LangChain, AI, and Rust positions me to innovate in both the blockchain and AI spaces. I’m confident I can bring value by not only delivering on the current needs but also future-proofing solutions.**
